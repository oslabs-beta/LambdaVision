# LambdaVision - AWS Lambda Observability Platform

LambdaVision is an open-source software project designed to provide clear, actionable insights into AWS Lambda functions. It simplifies the observability of serverless applications by offering a streamlined platform that focuses on real-time monitoring and performance tracking.

LambdaVision enables software engineers to gain deep visibility into Lambda function executions, making it easier to track invocation details, identify performance bottlenecks, and debug errors. By integrating with AWS CloudWatch, LambdaVision enhances the monitoring experience, offering actionable insights to optimize Lambda-based workloads and ensure smooth, efficient serverless applications.
